<h1>
Hello World!
	</h1>
<p>
Consider this paragraph of text. It's separated visually 
from the text above by a new line character that adds 
vertical spacing.
</p>

<p>
Also these paragraphs are indented from the left 
margin with tabs. Tabs and newlines are ignored so
this whole content will render as a single paragraph.
